# Chapter 5: "An acceptable level of chaos"

The walk from the grocery store to his apartment was three blocks of pure annoyance. Water kept dripping from his sweater, making this annoying *drip, drip, drip* sound on the sidewalk that matched his irritated heartbeat. Each drop felt like another reminder of how embarrassing that whole thing was.

Lee Jaemin didn't do chaos. Like, at all.

His whole life was organized perfectly. His darkroom was spotless. His camera settings were always exactly right. His apartment looked like something out of a minimalist magazine. He handled clients with the kind of professional distance that kept things simple and drama-free. He dealt with the world by keeping everyone at arm's length.

And that woman... that absolutely infuriating, gorgeous, completely chaotic woman had destroyed all of that in less than five minutes.

She didn't just get in his personal space. She basically set off an emotional bomb right in the middle of his perfectly controlled world, then had the nerve to knock him into a freaking vegetable sprinkler. A vegetable sprinkler! He could still feel all those other shoppers staring at him, some feeling sorry for him, others trying not to laugh.

He jammed his key into his apartment door way too hard, the sound echoing down the empty hallway. Inside, everything was quiet and cool. He dropped the plastic bag with that random can of cat food onto the kitchen counter. The sound was satisfyingly sharp.

"Meow?"

A small black cat with the most beautiful green eyes appeared from the bedroom, blinking slowly at him. This was Bori. Bori didn't wind around his legs like a maniac or scream about being hungry. Bori just showed up, figured out what was going on, and waited. A reasonable cat.

"Yeah, I got your food," Jaemin said, his voice still rough from anger. He pulled off the soaked sweater and dropped it on the floor with a gross wet sound. He'd probably just throw it away later. Shivering in just his t-shirt, he grabbed the can opener.

He kept thinking about what that woman had yelled at him. *"My cat is not 'just' anything! He's family!"*

Jaemin snorted as he opened the can. Family. People used that word for everything these days until it meant nothing. Bori wasn't family. Bori was... well, Bori was his companion. His responsibility. A living thing that he took care of properly. He didn't spoil Bori. He just gave him good food and a clean place to live based on what was actually healthy for cats. It was simple. He took care of Bori, and Bori didn't mess with his camera stuff or demand constant attention.

He scooped the food into a clean bowl and put it down. Bori walked over, smelled it carefully, and started eating like a normal cat.

See? No drama. No refusing to eat out of spite like that woman claimed her cat would do. That was honestly the most ridiculous thing he'd ever heard. He watched Bori eat, feeling a little less tense. This was what he liked. Control. Order. Things that made sense.

He grabbed a towel and started drying his hair, but it didn't help much with how cold he felt. As he rubbed the towel around, he kept seeing that woman's face. He hadn't wanted to really look at her, but it was impossible not to. The way her eyes went from surprised to angry so fast. How her face got all flushed when she was mad. The way she defended her cat like it was the most important thing in the world.

*"At least I care about someone other than myself!"*

That hit harder than the cold water had. He wasn't selfish. He was just... independent. There was a difference. He didn't need all the messy, complicated stuff that came with other people's feelings. He captured those feelings for work, and that was more than enough. Weddings, parties, anniversaries. He'd stand there with his camera, take the pictures everyone wanted, and then go back to his peaceful apartment.

He threw the towel aside and sat down at his computer. Work would help him forget about her angry face and shaky voice.

His calendar opened up with all his upcoming jobs. A notification was blinking: **Engagement Party - Yoon & Jin - Sat. 8 PM.**

Jaemin groaned and leaned back in his chair. Right. The torture session. Jin seemed like an okay guy, and he'd practically begged Jaemin to take the job. He'd only said yes because the money was good and Jin didn't try to show him a bunch of Pinterest inspiration boards. But the bride, Yoon, had sent him so many emails full of exclamation points and smiley face emojis that they gave him a headache.

He opened their file to check the shot list for Saturday. *Candid shots of guests having fun. The couple with their families. The toast. Cutting the cake...* It was all so predictable. A bunch of fake happiness moments that everyone expected.

His eyes landed on a note he'd written during his first call with Jin. **Maid of Honor: Minseo. Needs special attention. Friend of bride. Just went through a bad breakup. Really shy. Please be nice to her.**

Jaemin rolled his eyes. "Be nice." As if he was some kind of monster who needed a warning label. People always assumed the worst about him just because he didn't chat about the weather. He wasn't mean. He was just there to do his job. Why waste time on small talk when he had pictures to take?

Still, thinking about having to deal with a party full of strangers, plus some heartbroken girl who'd probably cry during the speeches, made him tired already. He just wanted to show up, get the shots, and leave. Hopefully this Minseo person wouldn't be the type to have a breakdown in front of his camera.

He rubbed his face with his hands, and his stupid brain decided to flash back to the grocery store again. To the way that woman's eyes had gotten all watery when she was frustrated.

*"You're absolutely right. I'm just a pathetic woman who spoils her cat because she has nothing better to do with her life."*

For just a second, all her anger had cracked, and he could see how hurt she really was underneath. And for just a second, he'd felt like a complete jerk. He hadn't been trying to make her feel bad. He'd just been annoyed. The world was full of annoying things, and after spending all day editing photos of other people's perfect relationships, he didn't have much patience left.

Her last question kept echoing in his quiet apartment. *"At least tell me your name so I can apologize properly!"*

He'd almost told her. The words had been right there. But what would've been the point? To make that embarrassing situation last even longer? To give her a name to remember when she thought about the rude, soaking wet guy from the pet food aisle? No way. Better to stay anonymous. Just a random unpleasant memory that she'd hopefully forget by tomorrow. He definitely planned to forget about her.

He stared at the engagement party details on his screen, feeling that familiar dread creep in. A whole night of fake smiles and pointless conversations. A whole night of dealing with exactly the kind of chaos he tried so hard to avoid.

He really hoped no one at that party would be even half as annoying as the woman from the grocery store. He wasn't sure he could handle another encounter like that without completely losing it.
