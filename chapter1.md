# Chapter 1: "The Blue Glow"

The only light in my room is the sickly blue glow of my phone screen. It's 2:37 AM. I should be sleeping. I have that big presentation tomorrow or well... technically later today. But sleep is a country I haven't had a visa for in months.

Instead, I'm here. On his profile. Again.

It's a new picture this time. Him on a hiking trail, sunlight making a stupid mess out of his (already) messy brown hair. He's smiling that stupid, lopsided grin... the one that used to be just for me. And next to him, there's a girl.

She's pretty, I'll give you that. Blonde, freckles, and a smile that looks genuinely happy. She's wearing his favorite grey hoodie... or should I say the one I bought him for our second anniversary. The one he swore he lost.

But here's the thing that really gets me. I know this girl. I've been studying her for weeks now like she's my final exam. Her name is Aria Chen, she's this influencer with 50K followers, and posts these aesthetic hiking photos every Tuesday and Friday at 6 PM sharp. She drinks oat milk lattes, has a skincare routine that costs more than my rent, and apparently looks better in my anniversary gift than I ever did.

Yes, I know how that sounds. But when your ex starts dating someone new, you become a detective whether you want to or not. Right?

My thumb hovers over the screen, this stupid traitorous little digit. I could zoom in. Right now. If I wanted to. I could torture myself with the details... the way his arm is wrapped around her waist, the way she leans into him like it's the most natural thing in the world. The way she's styled MY hoodie with these cute hiking boots that probably cost more than my car payment.

It's fine. I'm happy for him. Genuinely. Lol. Who am I kidding?

A hot, prickly feeling crawls up my throat. It's not sadness. Not anymore. It's something uglier. Something hollow.

I keep scrolling, my masochistic ritual I know by heart. There's the picture from his brother's wedding where Aria looks like she belongs in the family photos better than I ever did. The trip to the coast where they're doing that annoying couples pose on the beach. The golden retriever puppy they adopted together named 'Sunny.' Of course it is. Everything in his new life is so goddamn bright.

My finger slips and I almost 'like' a photo from three weeks ago. My heart does a frantic little thump-thump against my ribs as if it's an episode from Tom and Jerry. I snatch my thumb back like the screen's on fire. Close one.

Can you imagine the humiliation? Minseo Park, professional lurker and social media detective, accidentally endorsing the life her ex built after shattering hers. The notification would probably give him a good laugh. "Look honey, my crazy ex is still obsessed with us." Pathetic.

I switch to my notes app, words spilling out before I can stop them. My thumbs fly across the glass, clumsy and fast.

'He looks happy. Really really happy. I should be happy too. I have a good job, my own appaartment, I een managed to keep thata stupid ficus alive. So why does seiing him smile with someoen else feel like a punch to the gut? Its been a year. A WHOLE YEAR. I should be over it. I should be on a dating app or learning how to make sourdough like a normal person…but im just…here.looking at pictures… like a weirdo.'

My eyes blur. It's just so... tiring. Being this version of me who can't seem to move on while he's out there living his best life with someone else.

I close the notes app and swipe back to my camera roll. Past the work screenshots, the dumb shitty memes I never actually send to anyone, the seventeen nearly identical photos of Mochi curled up like a fat croissant. Until I hit the old photos. The Before times.

There he is. A photo I took of him sleeping, drool on the pillow and mouth hanging open like a dead fish. A video of us arguing over IKEA instructions and ending up in a fit of giggles when we couldn't figure out what a "dowel" was. Us on a park bench, sharing a single melting ice cream cone because we were too broke to buy two.

My face in those photos looks different. Lighter, somehow.

But then I remember what happened after that ice cream photo. How we fought about money on the walk home. He said I was "financially irresponsible" and I called him "emotionally unavailable." How we didn't talk for two days after that. Funny how Instagram doesn't have a filter for relationship problems.

I swipe to a screenshot I saved yesterday. One of those aesthetic quote posts with white text on a black background that always seem to know exactly what you're going through. The first words slice through me, clean and cold.

*Nostalgia is a beautiful liar. It shows you highlight reels while hiding all the reasons things ended.*

My thumb freezes over the screen. A highlight reel? Is that what it was? The IKEA giggles, the ice cream we shared... it felt so real then. But the post is right. It conveniently leaves out the memory of the slammed doors. The nights I cried in my car just to get away from the suffocating silence in our apartment. The way he'd check his phone during our conversations like I was boring him.

The text continues, as if it's been reading my diary. *Clinging to memories keeps you trapped between worlds. Physically here, but mentally living in moments that no longer exist. You're giving your present away to ghosts who have already moved on.*

A ghost. That's what he is now. But his ghost is heavy, pressing on my chest right now like Mochi when he decides my lungs are the perfect place to nap. And he's clearly not haunting the same house anymore. He's out there building a whole new life with hiking trails and golden retrievers and a girlfriend who probably never stalks her exes at 2 AM. I'm the only one left here with the ghosts.

Then comes the part that made me save the screenshot in the first place: *The hardest truth is that you're often remembering alone. While you're analyzing every detail of what used to be, they've created new stories that don't include you. They found peace by letting go of what you still hold onto.*

My vision blurs, the white letters deciding to dance for some reason. He found peace. Of course he did. Peace looks like a golden retriever named 'Sunny.' Peace looks like that stupid lopsided grin directed at someone else. Peace looks like my anniversary hoodie draped around someone else's shoulders. He didn't just let go of what we had. He gave it away. He recycled our entire relationship and made it better with someone else.

The final lines offer hope that feels about as reachable as the moon. *Your mind wasn't designed to live in the past. It was made for right now. For healing. For growing beyond what was. Let the past stay where it belongs. Today needs you more.*

I stare at those words until my phone feels too heavy in my hand. It's all true. Every damn word. He clearly found peace. He built a new story with better characters and plot development. I know we ended for good reasons. I know I wasn't happy then... not really. Not at the end. So why doesn't knowing any of this actually help?

What a load of inspirational bullshit. If moving on was as easy as reading a pretty quote and deciding to "let go," then why can't I? Why am I clutching onto a life that doesn't belong to me anymore?

A loud THUD from beside me makes me jump. Mochi has knocked over my water glass onto my laptop, and coffee from earlier is now dripping onto my phone screen. "Mochi, no!" I scramble to save my electronics, grabbing tissues to soak up the mess. My cat looks at me with those accusing green eyes, like he's saying "How dare you blame me for this?" Even my cat thinks I'm pathetic.

I clean up the mess and set my phone face down on the nightstand. The phone screen goes dark. Blessed darkness, but the silence that rushes in is worse. It's heavy. Now all I can hear is the hum of the fridge and the frantic useless beat of my own heart in my ears. I can't breathe. *gasp*

I reach for what's left of my water, my fingers trembling just a little. Take a sip. Let it cool the heat of embarrassment and longing that's been burning in my throat. I'm way too young for a nervous breakdown. I have a presentation in six hours that could make or break my promotion chances. I need to sleep. I need to stop this. But I can't.

Outside my window, the city is finally quiet. Most normal people are asleep by now. Mochi shifts at the foot of the bed, his warm weight settling against my ankle like an anchor. I scratch behind his ear, grateful for at least one relationship in my life that I can count on.

I close my eyes again; it is way too late for me to spiral. Just for a moment, let's try to get some rest. Tomorrow, I'll go to that presentation. I'll drink too much coffee and wear my best smile. Tomorrow, I'll live through just another ordinary day, and then come back and spiral in bed once again. Because apparently, this is who I am now. Minseo Park, 28, successful professional by day, pathetic social media stalker by night.

I wonder when it will end. I wonder if I even want it to.
