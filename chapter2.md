# Chapter 2: "You're a lifesaver! Minseo!"

**"Minseo-ssi, do you have the revised Q3 projections ready?"**

I don't look up from my screen, fingers dancing across the keyboard as I toggle between three different reports. The rhythm of typing has become my meditation.

*Click, click, enter, tab.*

Each keystroke builds a wall between me and everything else.

**"Which version? The one accounting requested yesterday or the one marketing wants with the adjusted demographic data?"**

**"Both."**

**"The accounting version is in your inbox. Marketing's will be ready in twenty minutes."**

I finally glance up at Team Leader Park, who's hovering by my desk with that particular brand of stress that comes from upper management breathing down your neck. 

His tie is slightly askew, sleeves pushed up past his elbows. It's oddly reassuring to see someone else drowning in deadlines.

**"Did they change the parameters again?"**

**"Actually, yes. They want regional breakdowns now too."**

*Of course they do.*

I bite back a sigh and open another tab in my already overcrowded browser. The screen fills with new columns, new data points, new puzzles to solve.

**"No problem. I'll have it done by lunch."**

**"You're a lifesaver."** He hurries off toward the conference room where voices are rising in what sounds like heated discussion about budget allocations.

Another crisis.  
Another fire to put out.

I sink back into my chair and let the numbers wash over me like a familiar song. Here, at my desk, surrounded by reports and pivot tables, everything makes sense. 

Two plus two always equals four. Formulas don't lie or change their minds or decide they want something different.

My phone buzzes against the desk. I ignore it, squinting at the data that's refusing to cooperate. 

The numbers blur together slightly, but that's probably because I've been staring at this screen since… way too early and it's now... I check the corner of my monitor. Almost noon. 

Five hours already. Time moves strangely when you're lost in data analysis.

**"Minseo, please tell me you're planning to eat lunch today and not just survive on coffee and those energy bars you keep in your drawer."**

Eunji appears beside my cubicle, holding a container that smells like something tangy. *Homemade kimchi jjigae maybe?*

Her workspace has expanded again. The succulents that started as a single plant have multiplied into a miniature garden spanning the entire surface of her desk divider. 

She's even added tiny decorative rocks and a small watering can the size of a shot glass.

**"I'll eat,"** I mumble, copying formulas into a new column. The familiar motion of dragging the cell border down and watching calculations populate automatically is strangely satisfying.

**"Just need to finish this first."**

**"That's what you said yesterday. And the day before that."** She leans against my desk, forcing me to actually make eye contact. 

**"Seriously, when's the last time you left the office before 8 PM?"**

I pause, trying to remember. The days have blurred together into one continuous stream of repetitions and urgent requests and client presentations. 

It's easier that way. Less time for my mind to wander to uncomfortable places.

**"Friday?"**

**"It's Wednesday, Minseo. And you left at 9:30 on Friday because I literally watched you pack up and walk to the elevator."**

Nine-thirty. Still early enough to stop by Honcho's store, grab dinner from the refrigerated section, and spread work documents across my dining table while eating triangle kimbap over the keyboard.

Work has become my most reliable companion, following me home each night without complaint.

My phone buzzes again. Then again.

The sound feels invasive, like someone knocking on a door I've deliberately locked and bolted. I reach for it automatically, but Eunji's faster, snatching it away before I can silence it.

**"Yoon?"** She reads the name on the screen with raised eyebrows. **"Isn't she your friend from university? The one who used to drag you to all those poetry readings in Hongdae?"**

**"Can I have my phone back?"** I hold out my hand, trying to keep the irritation out of my voice. 

The mention of poetry readings makes something twist uncomfortably in my chest. I used to enjoy those. Used to think they were romantic and intellectual and exactly the kind of thing sophisticated Seoul women did with their Friday nights.

**"I'm really busy right now."**

*Busy.* As long as I'm busy, no one expects me to explain why I've stopped being the person they used to know.

**"She's actually calling. Like, with her voice and everything."** Eunji waves the still-buzzing device. **"When's the last time someone called you for something that wasn't a work emergency?"**

*Never,* is the honest answer. Work calls have clear agendas and defined endpoints. Personal calls are minefields of emotion and expectation and questions I don't know how to answer.

**"Minseo-ssi!"** Team Leader Park's voice cuts across the office, a lifeline saving me from having to respond. **"Henderson Group on the line. They want to see preliminary numbers in an hour!"**

Thank god for client emergencies.

**"The regional breakdowns they asked for this morning, or the main projections?"** I call back, already pulling up the correct file while gesturing for Eunji to give me my phone.

**"Neither!"** he yells back, his voice tight with stress. **"They just emailed over a new budget. They want to see the impact on the final numbers, ASAP!"**

**"Of course they did,"** I mutter, finally managing to grab my buzzing phone. Three missed calls from Yoon. My stomach does a small, anxious flip. Three calls usually mean something important, or that she was finally fed up with my systematic avoidance of all social interaction.

**"You should call her back,"** Eunji says softly, watching my expression. **"She left messages. Sounded worried."**

**"What messages? I haven't checked—"**

**"I may have accidentally seen the preview when your screen lit up."** She looks appropriately guilty about the privacy invasion. **"She wants to meet today. Says it's important and she's been trying to reach you for weeks."**

*Important.* The word sits in my chest like a lead weight. The last time someone said we needed to have an important conversation, it was Jinhwan explaining why he'd been "confused about his feelings" and how Aria had helped him "figure things out" while I was planning weekend getaways and foolishly believing that three years together meant something.

My computer chimes with a new email notification. It's from Team Leader Park, the Henderson Group's new budget attached. The sound is like music to my ears.

**"I can't,"** I say, diving back into the report like it's a lifeboat in rough waters. **"Too much work."**

Too much work. It isn't entirely a lie. But even if my desk were completely clear, I'd find something to do. Work is the only place where I still feel competent, where problems have solutions that don't involve examining your own personal failings.

**"Minseo..."**

**"Really, Eunji. I'm fine. I just need to get through this quarter, then things will calm down."**

It's the same lie I tell myself every month. The same promise I've been making since Jinhwan moved out, taking half the furniture and all of my confidence with him. Things will never calm down because I don't want them to. 

Calm means silence, and silence means thinking, and thinking means remembering.

Eunji sighs but doesn't push further. She returns to her desk and her thriving succulent garden, probably to eat a proper lunch at a reasonable hour like a normal person with healthy boundaries.

I stare at Yoon's messages without opening them, thumb hovering over the screen. The preview shows enough to make my chest tight: *"need to talk," "important," "worried about you."* Whatever she wants to discuss can wait. Everything can wait.

This new Henderson crisis doesn't require emotional availability or explanations about why I've become someone who screens calls from friends. Being needed professionally is different from being needed personally.

It's cleaner, more straightforward, less likely to end with someone explaining why you weren't enough.

I put my phone face down and return to the report, letting the familiar rhythm of data entry wash over me. 

*Click, drag, calculate, format, repeat.*

 Each action builds the wall a little higher, each completed task another brick between me and the outside world.

But even as I lose myself in pivot tables and regression analyses, Yoon's name keeps flickering in my peripheral vision like a neon sign I'm trying to ignore. 

Three missed calls from someone I used to consider one of my closest friends. 

Someone who knew me before I learned to hide behind professional competence and manufactured emergencies.

*Maybe after I finish this report. Maybe after the Henderson presentation. Maybe after the next crisis resolves itself, which it won't, because there's always another crisis waiting in the wings. Maybe tomorrow.*

The familiar weight of postponement settles in my chest, but I push it down and focus on the screen. 

Numbers don't abandon you for someone with a better laugh or more adventurous spirit. 

Numbers don't explain why you weren't interesting enough to fight for. 

Numbers are reliable and predictable and safe.

And right now, *safe* is all I can handle.
