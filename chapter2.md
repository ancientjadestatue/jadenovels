# Chapter 2: "Professional Armor"

I'm convinced the alarm is a crime against humanity.

*urggh*

BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. Oh shut up already... shouldn't have stayed up so late. Getting 90 minutes of sleep doesn't feel good at all. I slap my hand around on the nightstand, knocking over the (thankfully now empty) glass and nearly sending my phone flying before finally hitting the snooze button.

Silence. Blessed, beautiful silence.

But it's a trap. I know it's a trap. Nine more minutes of lying here means nine more minutes for the ghosts to get comfortable. Nine more minutes to remember that Aria probably woke up next to him this morning, probably looking cute and refreshed while I look like something Mochi coughed up.

I force myself upright. The room spins a little, my head full of cotton and my eyes hurt like hell. Mochi is still fast asleep, curled in the warm spot I just left. He cracks open one eye, gives me a look that clearly says ‘you’re disturbing my slumber, peasant,’ then he curls back into a perfect donut and resumes his nap.

I stumble to the kitchen, my apartment feeling strangely big and empty for some reason. The ficus in the corner is still alive, thankfully. So that’s something. 

Small victories, right?

I need coffee. Not want, but need. The kind of life support that can make a zombie pass for a functioning human being for at least eight hours. While the machine gurgles and shakes itself to life, I lean against the counter with my phone in hand.

It's a reflex. A stupid, self-destructive reflex.

But I don't look him up this time. Progress, maybe? Instead, I open my work email and let corporate anxiety replace romantic anxiety. It's not healthier, exactly, but at least it's productive.

Thirty-seven unread emails. First off? A meeting reminder for the presentation that could make or break my promotion chances. Then, A passive-aggressive note from HR about dress code violations. 

Followed by 35 mails from LinkedIn about me being found in search results. Normal Tuesday morning stuff really.

Forty minutes later, I'm armored up. The black blazer that makes my shoulders look broader? Check. The white blouse that says 'trust me with your quarterly budget.'? Check. Shoes that hurt just enough to keep me grounded but not enough to make me limp? Also check. 

I stare at myself in the bathroom mirror while applying what Eunji would probably call 'an concerning amount' of concealer under my eyes. The woman looking back at me is a stranger. She looks tired but she also looks... competent. Put together. Like she has her life figured out.

She’s a pretty good liar, this girl in the mirror.

I have a whole mental script for mornings like this. Power pose in front of the mirror for thirty seconds because a TED talk said it works. Shoulders back, chin up. "You've got this, Minseo." Three deep breaths. Smile practice until it doesn't look like I'm in physical pain.

It sounds dramatic, but it works. Kind of.

The subway is crammed with the usual half-asleep crowd, and I can’t help but have that DAY6 song stuck in my head again, the one about being a zombie. How fitting. 

I find a seat and pull out the book my coworker James recommended last week, letting the melody loop in my brain while I try to focus on words about putting yourself out there and taking chances. Self-help disguised as a memoir.

I'm three pages in when I see him.

Not him him. But a guy in a grey hoodie, same messy brown hair, reading the exact same book that my ex recommended to me six months before we broke up. The book I never finished because every page reminded me of his voice explaining why I should "expand my emotional intelligence."

My stomach does that sick little flip-flop thing. For a split second, the subway car tilts and I'm back in our old apartment, him reading passages out loud while I pretended to listen and secretly wanted to throw the book out the window.

The guy looks up from his page and I realize he's nothing like my ex except for the hoodie and the hair and the fact that he's holding a book that apparently every emotionally unavailable man in Seoul owns.

Snap out of it, I tell myself. Today needs you more.

I close my eyes and focus on my breathing until my stop comes up. The professional version of me needs to show up in twenty minutes, and she doesn't have time for sidewalk breakdowns over random strangers in hoodies.

My office building is aggressively bright and clean, all glass and metal and motivational posters about us having organic food in the cafeteria. Whatever that means. 

Eunji from accounting is already at her desk, watering a small army of succulents while humming something that sounds suspiciously like a song I remember listening to. 

Might need to ask her about it later.

"Morning Minseo-ssi! Big day today!" she chirps, her voice way too sweet for this early in the morning. It’s not even 9 yet!

"The biggest," I manage, arranging my face into something that hopefully resembles enthusiasm rather than annoyance.

"You look a little tired though. Did you prepare enough? I brought extra donuts for brain power! The chocolate ones with sprinkles!"

I should be grateful. Eunji is sweet and means well. But all I can think is that she probably gets eight hours of sleep every night and has never had to watch her anniversary gift get recycled into someone else's relationship.

"Just nervous," I say, which isn't entirely a lie.

The presentation is at ten. Which is good since it gives me about an hour to transform into the version of myself that deserves a promotion. 

I review my notes one more time, practice my opening line in my head, and try not to think about anything that can distract me.

Right before ten, I walk into the conference room. The air conditioning hits me like a slap of reality. Department Head Kim is already seated at the head of the table, his expression as readable as a pug’s. The other department heads file in, clutching their coffee cups way too hard.

And then I start talking. Except it's not me. It’s the professional stranger from the mirror, the one who actually knows what she's doing. The numbers? They flow out of my mouth. As if I understand them. (It’s a lie. I spent three weeks making them make sense). 

My graphs suddenly look brilliant. Convincing, even. My voice is steady. I’m even making eye contact. Not once do I feel the urge to crawl under the table. 

For forty-five minutes, there are no ghosts in this room. No lopsided smiles or hiking trail photos or girls with perfect freckles wearing my hoodies. There's just data and analysis and the sound of my own voice explaining why our marketing strategy is going to revolutionize our Q4 numbers.

It's surreal like watching someone else live my life, but better.

When the stranger finally stops talking, the silence is terrifying. Then, a smattering of applause, which feels more genuine than the usual obligatory patter. Department Head Kim gives me one of his rare almost-smiles, the kind that might actually indicate approval rather than gas.

"Excellent work, Minseo-ssi. Very thorough analysis. We'll discuss the budget allocations and get back to you by Friday."

Friday…Promotion-decision day. His tone… it didn't sound like a dismissal. 

The adrenaline carries me back to my desk like I'm floating on a cloud of corporate success. I did it. I survived. I more than survived, actually. I killed it.

For the first time in months, I feel… good. Capable.

And then the adrenaline fades. The high vanishes.

I’m just... sitting. In my squeaky office chair, staring at the screen. The silence in this cubicle is suffocating. Just like my bedroom last night.

So what if I nailed the presentation? Doesn't change a thing. I'll still go home to an empty apartment and a cat who is, admittedly very cute but also very fat. And it sure as hell doesn't erase the image of him making breakfast for someone else. Singing.

Why did he never sing when he lived with me?

My phone buzzes against my desk, and my heart does that stupid Pavlovian thump-thump response that I've come to hate. Maybe it's Department Head Kim with early feedback. Maybe it's my mom calling me even though she never does without a good reason. Maybe it's—

It's not him. Of course it's not him. It's never him anymore.

My thumbs feel like lead as I unlock the screen.

The message is from Yoon, a name I haven't seen pop up on my screen in... God how long has it been? Months? Since before the breakup, probably. 

We used to be close, all throughout school and even in university. Back when I was the kind of person who maintained friendships instead of feeling exhausted by the idea of having to talk with people.

The message is short.

**Yoon**: Elm St. Coffee. 2 PM. Wanna meet up?

That's... unexpected. And slightly worrying? We've never really been the type to just casually meet up for coffee. And reaching out after so long for just coffee feels... I don't know. Either something's wrong or she needs something from me. Maybe both. 

I stare at the message for a long moment, my thumb hovering over the screen. 

Well…I could say I'm busy. I could make an excuse. I could pretend I didn't see it and continue hiding like I’ve been doing all this while.

But something about the presentation, about feeling competent for forty-five whole minutes, makes me type back:

**Me**: Okay.

Okay? Just okay? God, Minseo, what are you doing??

Yoon responds immediately with a thumbs-up emoji. Uhm…ominous.

I have a couple of hours to prepare myself for whatever conversation is about to happen. Hours to figure out how to explain why I've been ignoring her for the better part of a year.

This should be interesting.
