# Unfiltered

*A Contemporary Romance*

## Synopsis

In the blue glow of midnight scrolling, Minseo discovers that moving on isn't about forgettingâ€”it's about filtering through the noise to find your authentic self. When her ex appears to have moved on effortlessly with someone new, she must navigate the treacherous waters of social media stalking, professional pressures, and the complicated journey back to self-love.

This story explores how we curate our pain, the addictive nature of digital comparison, and the messy, beautiful process of healing in an age where everyone's life looks perfect online.

- **Digital Detox vs. Digital Dependency**: How social media affects our healing process
- **Professional Identity**: Balancing career ambitions with personal growth  
- **Authentic Self-Discovery**: Finding who you are beneath the filters
