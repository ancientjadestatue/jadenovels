In the blue glow of midnight scrolling, Minseo discovers that moving on isn't about forgettingâ€”it's about filtering through the noise to find your authentic self. When her ex appears to have moved on effortlessly with someone new, she must navigate the treacherous waters of social media stalking, professional pressures, and the complicated journey back to self-love.
