# Chapter 3: After Hours

The office had that strange quiet energy that only came after 8 PM. Most of the cubicles sat empty, their monitors dark, chairs pushed neatly under desks. 

The only sound was the steady hum of the fluorescent lights, a noise that felt as stubborn as I was. Still here, still working.

I adjusted my posture and clicked through to the next tab. The quarterly report was finished, had been finished since 6 PM actually, but the regional breakdown could use another review. 

Maybe the charts would look better with a different color scheme. Maybe I could make the font a little bigger.

**"Minseo-ssi."**

I looked up to find Team Leader Park hovering by my desk, briefcase in hand but no movement toward the elevator. His tie was loosened, sleeves rolled up… the universal signals of a man who'd put in his hours but couldn't quite bring himself to leave first.

**"The Henderson projections are ready,"** I said, gesturing to my screen. **"I'm just checking the formulas in section three again."**

**"It's almost nine."** His voice was low.

**"I know. Just want to make sure everything's perfect for tomorrow's presentation."** I turned back to my monitor, fingers dancing across the keyboard in a familiar rhythm. 

Numbers didn't judge. Numbers didn't disappoint. Numbers simply were.

Team Leader Park shifted his weight. **"You've been staying late every night this week."**

**"Big project season,"** I replied without looking up. **"You know how it is."**

He made a sound that might have been agreement or concern. Hard to tell. 

After a moment, I heard his footsteps retreating toward the elevator. The soft ding of its arrival echoed through the empty office, followed by the quiet whoosh of the doors closing.

Silence settled back over the room again. Finally, some peace.

I pulled up another spreadsheet, this one for next week's client meeting. Technically, it wasn't due until Friday, but getting ahead never hurt anyone. 

The cursor blinked patiently as I stared at the empty cells, waiting for me to fill them.

My phone buzzed against the desk. Then again. And again.

I flipped it face down without checking the caller ID. Whatever it was could wait until tomorrow. 

Tonight belonged to pivot tables and regression analyses and the comfortable complexity of data that made sense.

9:30 PM arrived with the gentle chime of my computer's hourly reminder. Time to wrap up, though wrapping up felt more like an interruption than a natural conclusion.

I saved my files and shut down my computer, my movements automatic. I'd done this same routine every night for weeks.

The elevator ride down felt slow. Through the glass, I could see the lights of Seoul stretching out forever. 

So many other buildings were still lit up. It was a little comforting to know I wasn't the only one.

The small corner store glowed like a beacon in the night. Red Dog Mini Mart, with its hand-painted sign that had seen better days and windows covered in colorful advertisements for energy drinks and phone cards.

The bell above the door chimed cheerfully as I pushed inside, and the familiar scent of instant coffee and cleaning products greeted me.

**"Evening, young lady!"** came the boisterous voice from behind the counter.

Honcho was arranging a new display of western movie DVDs next to the register, his round face beaming with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for children on Christmas morning.

A Clint Eastwood poster from "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" hung prominently behind him, next to what looked like a signed photograph of John Wayne that was probably fake but made him happy nonetheless.

**"New arrivals today,"** he announced proudly, gesturing to the DVD collection like he was unveiling precious artifacts. **"Got a whole box of classics from an estate sale. Look at this beauty."** 

He held up a copy of "Tombstone" with reverent hands. **"Still in the original packaging."**

I grabbed a basket and wandered the familiar aisles while Honcho continued his excited commentary about his latest acquisitions. The store was cramped but organized with the precision of someone who knew exactly where everything belonged. 

Western movie memorabilia mixed seamlessly with everyday necessities. A "Wanted" poster for Billy the Kid hung above the instant noodle display, and a small cactus sat on the windowsill next to a miniature cowboy boot planter.

**"You know,"** Honcho called out as I selected my usual ramen varieties, **"Kurt Russell was supposed to be in three more westerns after Tombstone, but the studios got scared of the genre dying out. Shame, really. The man was born to wear a cowboy hat."**

I made appropriate murmuring sounds while navigating to the refrigerated section. Triangle kimbap for tomorrow's breakfast, or lunch, or whenever I remembered to eat. 

The routine had become automatic, like muscle memory for survival.

The drink cooler hummed quietly as I selected my energy drinks. Two, then a third for good measure. 

Caffeine had become my most reliable companion, more dependable than sleep or proper meals or social interaction.

**"Those energy drinks will rot your teeth,"** Honcho said cheerfully as I passed his counter, but without any real judgment in his voice. 

**"'Course, so will most things worth enjoying. My wife used to say I'd die from all the coffee I drink, but here I am at sixty-two, still kicking like a mustang."**

Near the checkout, I saw he had a new display of sheet masks near the register. I grabbed a few. 

My reflection in the glass of the cooler door showed me exactly why I needed them, but I quickly looked away.

**"Find everything you need tonight?"** Honcho asked as I approached the counter, his weathered hands already reaching for a plastic bag.

Behind him, a new addition to his collection caught my eye: a poster for "3:10 to Yuma" that looked like it had been carefully preserved.

**"Yes, thank you."** I set my items down and watched him scan each one with the careful attention of someone who took pride in even the smallest tasks.

His movements were unhurried despite the late hour, as if he had all the time in the world to make sure everything was perfect.

**"Plastic okay? I keep meaning to get those fancy paper bags, but the plastic ones are stronger. Don't want your ramen falling through the bottom on the way home."** 

He bagged my purchases with the same care he probably used when handling his precious movie collection, placing the heavier items at the bottom, the sheet masks on top where they wouldn't get crushed.

**"That's perfect."**

**"You know,"** he said, handing me the bag with his characteristic grin, **"Clint Eastwood did all his own stunts in the spaghetti westerns. Even at his age, the man was tougher than leather. That's the kind of dedication you don't see anymore."**

I found myself almost smiling despite my exhaustion. **"Have a good night, Honcho."**

**"You too, young lady. Get some rest when you can. Even cowboys need to sleep sometime."**

The walk to my apartment was exactly four minutes. I'd timed it. Four minutes to get ready for the silence waiting inside.

My apartment greeted me with the same stale air and accumulated neglect as always. Mail sat unopened on the counter, a growing mountain of bills and promotional flyers that I'd get to eventually.

The dining table had disappeared under a sprawl of work documents, my laptop cord snaking across the surface like a vine.

I set my convenience store bag on the kitchen counter next to the others from previous nights. The refrigerator hummed when I opened it, revealing the layers of my recent eating habits.

Takeout containers from different restaurants, expired yogurt cups, and a bag of wilted lettuce I'd bought with good intentions three weeks ago.

The triangle kimbap went onto the middle shelf, where it would keep company with its predecessors until I remembered to eat it or threw it away, whichever came first.

My phone buzzed from my purse. Then buzzed again. 

I ignored it and headed for the bathroom, leaving the device buried among my work papers like a small pesky creature I didn't want to deal with.

The hot water of the shower felt good. Shampoo, rinse, conditioner, rinse, body wash, rinse. 

The routine had a hypnotic quality that helped quiet the constant chatter in my head… tomorrow's meetings, next week's deadlines, the client presentation that needed just one more revision.

Brushing my teeth, I caught my reflection in the bathroom mirror. The woman looking back seemed familiar. 

Like of course it looked like me, be weird if it didn't, but it was like seeing yourself from someone else's eyes.

When had my cheekbones become so sharp? When had the circles under my eyes become a permanent feature rather than a temporary consequence of a late night? 

When did that happen?

The bed felt too big as I slipped under the covers, my laptop balanced on my knees despite every intention of going straight to sleep. Just a quick check of tomorrow's calendar.

Just a review of the morning's first presentation. Just a glance at the emails that had accumulated during my shower.

My phone buzzed again. Seven missed calls, all from Yoon.

My thumb hovered over her name on the screen. Seven calls meant something. Seven calls meant urgency or worry or news that couldn't wait for regular business hours. 

Seven calls meant a conversation I wasn't equipped to handle right now.

I closed the phone and set it on the nightstand. 

*Tomorrow.*

Yeah. I'd text her back tomorrow, when I had the mental energy to be the friend she deserved. When I could figure out what to say about the radio silence and the missed birthday dinner and the way I'd been systematically disappearing from my own life.

The laptop screen glowed in the darkened room as I pulled up next week's project files. Just a quick review before sleep. Just a small head start on tomorrow's workload.

Just another hour of purposeful distraction from the silence that seemed to grow louder when I wasn't busy enough to ignore it.

Outside my window, Seoul continued its restless existence. Other apartment buildings stretched into the darkness, their windows lit with the lives of other people.

People who probably had normal schedules and social plans and refrigerators stocked with actual food instead of convenience store food.

I adjusted my position against the pillows and lost myself in spreadsheets, in the comfortable complexity of work that never asked uncomfortable questions or expected emotional availability I didn't have.

Numbers were reliable. Deadlines were achievable. Projects had clear beginnings, middles, and ends.

Unlike everything else in my life these days.
