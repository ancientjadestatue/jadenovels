# Chapter 6: Evening Light

The evening air felt different against my skin as I stepped out of the office building. Not harsh like the aggressive afternoon sun from yesterday's brief lunch experiment, but gentle. Golden. The kind of light that photographers probably had fancy names for, but I just knew as... nice.

When was the last time I'd walked anywhere while the sun was still up? Even now, dusk was starting to settle over Seoul, painting the buildings in shades of amber and rose that made everything look softer around the edges.

Team Leader Park. I tested the words again in my mind, and that warm feeling bubbled up in my chest. My hard work had actually paid off. Someone had noticed. Someone had thought I was worth promoting.

My phone buzzed. Yoon's name flashed on the screen with a preview: *"Minseo, I know you're busy but—"*

I slipped the phone back into my bag without reading the rest. Not today. Today was too good to let guilt creep in around the edges. Whatever conversation we needed to have could wait one more day.

The walk to Honcho's mart felt different in the early evening. The streets were busier with people heading home from work, but not in a rushed way. More leisurely. Like they had somewhere to be but weren't racing against time to get there.

The familiar red glow of the Red Dog Mini Mart sign came into view, and I could see Honcho through the window, animated as always, talking to someone at the counter. His hands were gesturing enthusiastically, probably explaining some piece of western movie trivia that his customer may or may not have asked about.

The bell chimed its cheerful greeting as I pushed through the door.

**"Well, look who's here before midnight for once!"** Honcho called out, his round face lighting up with genuine pleasure. **"Evening, young lady!"**

**"Evening, Honcho."**

He was rearranging something behind the counter. A new batch of movie posters maybe? these ones still in protective plastic sleeves.

**"Beautiful evening, isn't it? Perfect weather for a walk. Reminds me of those sunset scenes in 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.' You know that one?"**

**"I don't think so."**

**"Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne. Classic. The way they filmed those sunset scenes, you'd think they had magic cameras back then."** He gestured toward the window where the golden light was filtering in. **"Course, nothing beats the real thing."**

I grabbed a basket and started my usual route through the aisles, but slower than normal. There was no rush tonight. No urgent deadline waiting for me at home.

**"You seem different tonight,"** Honcho observed as I passed the refrigerated section. **"Lighter, somehow. Good day at work?"**

**"Actually, yes. Very good day."**

**"Ah, I can always tell. Thirty years of running this place, you learn to read people. Good news has its own energy, you know? Like when Clint Eastwood finally got the green light to direct 'Unforgiven.' You could probably see the satisfaction radiating from him for miles."**

I found myself actually smiling at this comparison. **"I got a promotion."**

**"A promotion!"** Honcho clapped his hands together, the sound echoing through the small store. **"Well, that calls for celebration. Hold on."**

He disappeared behind the counter and emerged with two small bottles of what looked like fancy sparkling juice. **"On the house. Nothing too exciting, but better than energy drinks for toasting good fortune."**

**"Honcho, you don't have to—"**

**"Nonsense. Success should be acknowledged. In the old west, they'd fire their guns in the air, but the neighbors might complain."**

As I continued shopping, I became aware of another customer in the store. A man browsing the instant meal section with the kind of intense concentration usually reserved for important documents. He was... well, objectively speaking, quite handsome. The kind of handsome that would make people turn their heads on the street. But there was something distant about his expression, like his mind was somewhere else entirely.

**"That young man's been staring at the same shelf for ten minutes,"** Honcho said quietly as I approached the counter with my items. **"Looks like he's trying to solve the mysteries of the universe through ramen packaging."**

I glanced over briefly. The man was holding two different cups of instant noodles, comparing them with the seriousness of someone making a life-altering decision.

**"Maybe he's just particular about his food choices,"** I said.

**"Maybe. Or maybe he's got something heavy on his mind. You see all types in here. The late-night crowd especially. People shopping when they should be sleeping usually have stories."**

Honcho rang up my purchases with his usual careful attention, placing the sparkling juice bottles gently in the bag.

**"You know, in 'High Noon,' Gary Cooper spends most of the movie waiting for something to happen. Sometimes the waiting is harder than the actual event."**

I wasn't entirely sure what that had to do with anything, but Honcho's movie analogies had their own logic that I'd learned not to question.

**"Thank you for this,"** I said, holding up the bag. **"And for the congratulations."**

**"Thank you for sharing good news. This old place needs more of it."** He grinned and gestured toward his movie collection. **"Now go home and celebrate properly. Even John Wayne knew when to call it a day."**

As I headed toward the door, I heard Honcho address the other customer: **"Find what you're looking for, son?"**

The man's response was too quiet for me to hear, but something in his voice sounded tired. Not physically tired—the kind of tired that sleep couldn't fix.

The bell chimed behind me as I stepped back into the evening air. The four-minute walk home stretched ahead, and for once, I wasn't in a hurry to cover the distance. The golden light was fading to purple now, and the city was settling into its nighttime rhythm.

Behind me, the Red Dog Mini Mart glowed like a small beacon of warmth and western movie wisdom, with Honcho probably still dispensing life advice through Clint Eastwood quotes to anyone who needed to hear it.
