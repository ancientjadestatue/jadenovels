# Chapter 1: "The Morning Routine"

The alarm goes off at **5:30 AM**, same as every weekday for the past four months. I reach over to silence it before the second beep, muscle memory guiding my hand to the nightstand in the dark.

The apartment is quiet except for the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen and the distant sound of early morning traffic building on the streets below.

I sit up in bed, feet finding the cold hardwood floor. The studio apartment feels *too big and too small at the same time* -too big for just me, too small for all the things I couldn't take when I left. The walls are mostly bare except for a single framed photo of my parents and a small succulent that Eunji gave me, which keeps threatening to die despite my best attempts.

My phone shows three missed notifications from work apps and a reminder about today's schedule. I swipe them away and pad to the bathroom, avoiding the mirror until I absolutely have to look at myself.

The routine is always the same: shower, skincare, hair pulled back in the neat bun that's become my uniform. Everything efficient and controlled, like the spreadsheets I'll spend the next twelve hours perfecting.

It's while I'm brushing my teeth that I hear it.

Someone in the apartment upstairs is playing piano. The melody drifts down through the thin walls, something classical and melancholic that I almost recognize. My hand freezes mid-brush, toothpaste foam filling my mouth as the notes cascade in a pattern that feels achingly familiar.

*Debussy. Clair de Lune.*

The same piece I used to play every morning in the apartment we shared. The same piece he said was his favorite, the reason he bought me that upright piano for my birthday two years ago.

*"Now you can play for me every day,"* he said, and kissed my forehead while I touched the keys for the first time.

I spit out the toothpaste and grip the edge of the sink, but the music keeps going. Whoever's playing upstairs keeps stumbling over the same delicate section in the middle where the melody becomes so soft it almost disappears. That part I used to hate, that I practiced for hours until my fingers finally got it right.

The piano is probably still there, in what used to be our living room. When I went back to collect my things, he wasn't even home. Aria answered the door instead, wearing one of his t-shirts and an apologetic smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.

> "Minseo-ssi, I'm really sorry, but Jinhwan oppa said you can only take your personal things. The piano... well, he did buy it, so technically it's his."

I wanted to tell her that it didn't matter who paid for it. *I* was the one who spent hours learning all his favorite songs. *I* was the one who made that apartment feel like home with music every morning. But I just stood there looking at this girl who was already comfortable in my space, wearing my boyfriend's clothes, and said *okay*. I took my clothes and my books and my diplomas and left everything else behind.

The playing stops abruptly upstairs, followed by the sound of someone sighing in frustration. The quiet after feels oppressive, like it's pressing down on me.

I work for one of the **Big Four accounting firms** in Seoul. The name doesn't really matter since they're all the same blend of corporate efficiency and endless spreadsheets.

I'm a junior associate in the **M&A division**, specifically on the tax compliance team. When one company wants to buy another, part of the due diligence process involves figuring out exactly how much the target company might owe in back taxes across different jurisdictions.

It's not glamorous work, but it's precise. 

*Numbers don't lie, and they don't suddenly decide they'd rather be with someone else's calculations.*

Most deals are straightforward, but sometimes you get the interesting cases. Last month, I worked on a mid-sized logistics company that had been operating delivery routes through six different provinces but had only been filing taxes in three of them.

The potential liability was enough to make the buyer walk away. Saved them about **2 billion won** in back taxes and penalties.

That's the thing about my job. There's always a clear right and wrong answer. Either the taxes were filed correctly or they weren't. Either the liability exists or it doesn't. It's refreshingly black and white in a world that seems determined to exist in shades of gray.

The piano starts up again upstairs, the same piece, the same stumbling passage. This time, I force myself to listen without flinching, to let the notes wash over me like exposure therapy. By the time I'm dressed and ready for work, I've managed to separate the melody from the memory. *Almost.*

I grab my bag and check my reflection one more time in the hallway mirror. Navy blazer, white blouse, black slacks. Hair neat, makeup minimal but professional. I look like someone who has her life together, someone who chose this apartment and this routine and this carefully controlled existence.

The woman in the mirror doesn't look like someone who used to play piano every morning for the person she thought she'd marry. She doesn't look like someone who spent three weeks sleeping on a friend's couch because she couldn't bear to apartment hunt while her life was falling apart. She looks competent, put-together, successful.

I have everything I thought I wanted at twenty-five: a good job at a prestigious company, my own apartment in Gangnam, financial independence, and a clear career trajectory. On paper, my life is exactly what I planned when I was a university student with big dreams and bigger confidence.

So why does everything feel hollow? Why does success taste like convenience store meals eaten alone at my desk? Why can't I listen to classical music without feeling like someone's reached into my chest and squeezed?

The questions follow me as I lock the apartment and head toward the elevator. Outside, Seoul is waking up in its usual efficient chaos. Commuters rushing toward subway stations, coffee shops opening their doors, the city humming with the energy of too many people starting their day with the same determined exhaustion I recognize in myself.

I join the stream of professionals heading to work, another navy suit in a sea of navy suits and carefully controlled expressions. By the time I reach the office, I've pushed the morning's melancholy down to where it belongs, somewhere beneath the spreadsheets and client presentations and urgent emails that will fill the next twelve hours.

The piano upstairs will probably still be playing when I get home tonight. Maybe by then, I'll have figured out how to stop listening. Or maybe I'll just work late enough that it won't matter anymore.
