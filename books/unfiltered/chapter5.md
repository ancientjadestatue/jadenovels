# Chapter 5: "Team Leader...Minseo"

Or so I had thought.

The afternoon settled into its usual rhythm of spreadsheet cells and email notifications. Around me, the office hummed with the familiar sounds of productivity: keyboards clicking, phones ringing, the occasional sigh of someone discovering a calculation error. 

I pulled up the Morrison account files, the quarterly review materials I'd been meaning to tackle all week. The numbers stared back at me from the monitor, waiting to be organized into something that would make sense to executives who cared more about trends than details.

**"You can leave early today."**

I looked up to find Team Leader Park standing beside my desk again, but this time his expression was different. Less concerned, more... pleased about something.

**"Huh?"**

**"Pack up. Go home. It's almost five anyway."**

I glanced at the clock. 4:47 PM. For normal people, this would indeed be almost quitting time. For me, it felt like the middle of the afternoon.

**"But the Morrison account—"**

**"Is being handled by someone else."**

The words hung in the air between us. I blinked at my monitor, then back at him.

**"Someone else?"**

**"Naruto from Team C is taking over their quarterly review. I reassigned it this morning."**

A cold feeling settled in my stomach. **"Is it me? Did I mess up somewhere? I promise I can fix whatever—"**

**"Minseo."** His voice was gentle but firm. **"Stop."**

I stopped.

**"You didn't mess up. In fact, you're too good at this work."**

**"Too good?"**

Team Leader Park pulled over a chair from the neighboring desk and sat down, bringing himself to my eye level. **"When's the last time you worked on something that actually challenged you?"**

I opened my mouth to answer, then closed it. 

**"The Henderson presentation this morning was excellent, but you could have prepared it in half the time. The Morrison quarterly review? Any junior associate could handle that. You're doing work that's beneath your skill level."**

**"I don't understand."**

**"I sent a recommendation to headquarters yesterday."** He paused, and something that might have been a smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. **"For your promotion to team leader."**

The words didn't process immediately. I stared at him, waiting for the rest of the sentence, the part that would make this make sense.

**"Promotion?"**

**"Senior Manager Kim called me an hour ago. They want to fast-track your advancement. There's an opening in the International Tax Advisory division."**

**"But... what about you?"**

The almost-smile became a real smile. **"What about me?"**

**"If I get promoted to team leader, and you're already team leader, then..."** I trailed off, the implications starting to dawn on me.

**"Then I won't be team leader anymore."**

My heart sank. **"Oh no. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for—"**

**"Minseo."** He was laughing now, actually laughing. **"I got promoted too."**

**"What?"**

**"Senior Manager. International Tax Advisory division. They want me to head up the new cross-border compliance unit."**

I stared at him. **"Senior Manager?"**

**"Senior Manager."**

**"And they want me to...?"**

**"Take over Team B under the new structure. Your own team of junior associates. Real complex cases, not quarterly reviews and basic compliance checks."**

The information swirled in my head like numbers that wouldn't add up correctly. **"Wait. Wait, wait, wait."**

**"I know it's a lot."**

**"You got promoted to Senior Manager?"**

**"Yes."**

**"And they want to promote me to Team Leader?"**

**"Yes."**

**"Of my own team?"**

**"Your own team."**

I looked around the office, suddenly seeing it differently. Eunji at her desk with her succulent garden. The other associates bent over their monitors. The familiar territory that had become my entire world.

**"When?"**

**"Next month. They want us both to start the transition immediately."**

**"Next month."**

**"Are you going to keep repeating everything I say?"**

I laughed, surprising myself with the sound. **"Maybe. This is... I mean, Senior Manager Park, this is incredible."**

**"I'm not Senior Manager Park yet."**

**"But you will be."**

**"I will be."**

We sat in silence for a moment, the weight of change settling between us like dust in afternoon light.

**"I can't believe they want to promote me,"** I said finally.

**"I can. You've been ready for months. You just needed someone to notice."**

**"And you noticed."**

**"I noticed."**

Another pause. Around us, other associates were starting to pack up for the day, the 5 PM exodus beginning its slow migration toward the elevators.

**"What's the International Tax Advisory division like?"**

**"Complex. Challenging. The kind of work where your attention to detail actually matters because mistakes cost clients millions."**

**"Millions?"**

**"Millions."**

I thought about this. Real responsibility. Real consequences. Work that couldn't be reduced to routine quarterly reviews and basic compliance checks.

**"Are you nervous?"** I asked.

**"Terrified,"** he admitted. **"You?"**

**"Terrified."**

**"Good. That means we care."**

**"Senior Manager Park,"** I said, testing the title.

**"Team Leader Minseo,"** he replied.

We grinned at each other like children who had just discovered they were getting ice cream for dinner.

**"I should probably go home and process this,"** I said.

**"You should. And Minseo?"**

**"Yes?"**

**"Try to celebrate a little. You earned this."**

I started shutting down my computer, closing files and organizing papers with hands that felt oddly light. Team Leader. My own team. Complex cases that would actually use my skills.

**"Hey, future Senior Manager?"**

**"Yes?"**

**"Thank you. For noticing. For the recommendation. For... everything."**

He stood up, pushing the borrowed chair back to its proper desk. **"Thank you for being worth noticing."**

As I gathered my things, I caught sight of Eunji watching us with curious eyes over her monitor.

**"Good news?"** she called over.

**"Very good news,"** Team Leader Park answered before I could respond. **"Tell her tomorrow, Minseo. After you've had time to let it sink in."**

I nodded, slinging my bag over my shoulder. For the first time in months, I was leaving the office before 7 PM, and it felt strange and wonderful and slightly terrifying all at once.

The elevator doors closed behind me, and I watched the floor numbers decrease toward ground level, toward home, toward a future that had just become infinitely more complicated and interesting than triangle kimbap and quarterly reviews.

Team Leader Minseo.

The title echoed in my head all the way down.
