# Chapter 4: Small Luxuries

**"While walking into the cafe, I had a feeling you'd already be in the office, so I got you some as well. Looks like I was right."**

Team Leader Park appeared beside my desk holding two paper cups, steam curling from their plastic lids like small prayers to the caffeine gods. The clock in the corner of my monitor read 7:23 AM.

I looked up from the spreadsheet I'd been tweaking since 6:45, blinking away the numbers that had started to blur together. **"Thank you. You didn't have to do that."**

**"Americano, extra shot."** He set the cup carefully on my desk, away from my keyboard. **"The barista remembered your usual order. Said you haven't been in for weeks."**

*Weeks.* Had it really been that long since I'd made the walk to the cafe downstairs? Since I'd stood in line with other normal people who left their desks for ten minutes to buy overpriced coffee and exchange pleasantries about the weather?

I wrapped my fingers around the warm cup, grateful for something to hold that wasn't a mouse or a pen. **"I've been bringing coffee from home."**

It wasn't entirely a lie. I had been bringing coffee from home, if instant coffee mixed with hot water from the office kitchen counted as bringing coffee from home. Which it probably didn't.

Team Leader Park lingered by my desk, sipping his drink and studying my monitor with the expression of someone trying to solve a puzzle. **"The Henderson presentation isn't until ten. You know that, right?"**

**"Just wanted to run through the numbers one more time."** I clicked refresh on my email, watching three new messages appear. **"Make sure everything flows properly."**

**"You've run through those numbers six times since yesterday. They're perfect."**

*Perfect.* The word sat strangely in the air between us. Nothing felt perfect lately, especially not me sitting here at 7 in the morning, pretending that reviewing the same data for the seventh time was productive rather than compulsive.

**"Better safe than sorry,"** I said, taking a sip of the coffee. It was good. Real coffee, with actual flavor and the kind of warmth that instant powder could never replicate. 

When had I stopped treating myself to small luxuries like properly made coffee?

Team Leader Park made that sound again, the one that might have been agreement or concern. **"Take a break after the presentation today. Maybe leave at a reasonable hour for once."**

He walked away before I could respond, leaving me alone with my perfectly reviewed presentation and a cup of coffee that tasted like a reminder of the person I used to be.

The presentation went exactly as expected, which is to say it went like every other due diligence presentation in the history of M&A transactions.

**"Good morning, gentlemen,"** I said to the Henderson Group as they filed into Conference Room B, each carrying identical leather portfolios and wearing variations of the same navy suit. Mr. Henderson himself was distinguishable only by his slightly more expensive tie and the way he claimed the chair at the head of the table as if by divine right.

**"Morning, Minseo-ssi,"** Mr. Henderson said, settling into his chair with the practiced ease of a man who attended seventeen meetings exactly like this one every week. **"How's the weather treating you?"**

**"Can't complain, sir. Shall we begin?"**

**"Let's dive right in,"** said Mr. Kim from Henderson Group, opening his portfolio with a crisp snap. **"We're eager to see where we stand on the Daehan Industries acquisition."**

I clicked to the first slide. Tax Compliance Review: Daehan Industries Due Diligence. The kind of title that managed to sound both critical and completely mind-numbing.

**"As you can see here,"** I began, my laser pointer tracing red circles around numbers that represented three months of digging through corporate tax filings, **"our preliminary assessment indicates potential exposure across multiple tax jurisdictions."**

**"Define potential exposure,"** asked Mr. Lee, the youngest Henderson Group member, who always asked at least one question to justify his presence in the room.

**"We've identified approximately 2.4 billion won in questionable deductions claimed between 2021 and 2023, primarily related to overseas subsidiary consolidations."**

Mr. Henderson nodded gravely, as if 2.4 billion won in tax exposure were the most fascinating liability he'd encountered since breakfast. **"And the likelihood of NTS pursuing this?"**

**"Based on similar cases and current enforcement patterns, I'd estimate a sixty-seven percent probability of audit within eighteen months post-acquisition."**

**"Sixty-seven percent,"** repeated Mr. Kim, writing something in his notebook that was probably more important than my carefully calculated risk assessment but looked very official. **"That's... specific."**

It was specific because I'd spent two weeks building probability models that nobody would remember after lunch, but specificity made everything sound more credible than "probably likely maybe."

I clicked to slide four. Cross-Border Transfer Pricing Analysis: Red Flags and Mitigation Strategies. The subtitle promised insights that would bore everyone to tears within minutes.

**"Daehan's transfer pricing documentation shows several concerning patterns,"** I continued, **"particularly in their intellectual property licensing arrangements with their Singapore subsidiary."**

**"Concerning how?"** said Mr. Henderson, leaning forward with the expression of a man who had never personally filed a tax return but needed to sound engaged.

**"The pricing methodologies lack adequate economic substance. Their IP licensing fees appear inflated relative to market benchmarks, which could trigger transfer pricing adjustments."**

**"Transfer pricing adjustments,"** echoed Mr. Lee, nodding as if this phrase contained profound wisdom rather than accounting jargon that made grown adults want to take naps.

The presentation continued in this vein for eighteen more slides. Each slide contained variations of tax regulations presented in increasingly colorful charts. Each chart prompted the same types of questions that generated the same types of carefully hedged responses.

**"Looking at this VAT compliance timeline,"** I said, pointing at a graphic that looked like a timeline of bureaucratic despair, **"we can see clear remediation opportunities before closing."**

**"What kind of remediation?"** asked Mr. Kim, who had been staring at the VAT timeline with the concentration of someone trying to understand why anyone chose accounting as a career.

**"Voluntary disclosure programs combined with enhanced documentation protocols. We're looking at a comprehensive compliance review across all subsidiaries."**

The beautiful thing about sentences like these was that they sounded like solutions while describing months of additional work that would cost more than the original tax liability.

**"And the bottom line impact?"** This from Mr. Henderson, the question everyone had been waiting for because it was the only one that actually mattered in M&A transactions.

**"Conservative estimate puts total exposure at 8.2 billion won across all jurisdictions, assuming worst-case scenario enforcement. We recommend establishing a 12 billion won reserve to account for penalties and interest."**

**"Twelve billion,"** Mr. Henderson repeated, because large numbers required repetition to fully appreciate their ability to destroy quarterly earnings.

Mr. Lee and Mr. Kim exchanged the kind of meaningful look that suggested they had discussed this exact range in their car on the way over, probably while complaining about how tax lawyers made everything more complicated than it needed to be.

**"The reserve allocation seems prudent given regulatory uncertainty,"** I added, clicking to a slide covered in worst-case scenarios that made the acquisition look like financial Russian roulette.

**"Regulatory uncertainty,"** murmured Mr. Kim, as if testing the words for their ability to explain things to shareholders later.

The meeting reached its natural conclusion after exactly thirty-seven minutes, which was the perfect length for everyone to feel adequately concerned without actually changing any decisions.

**"Excellent work as always, Minseo-ssi,"** Mr. Henderson said, standing and straightening his tie. **"Your attention to detail continues to impress us. This kind of thorough analysis is exactly why we work with your firm."**

**"Thank you, sir. Tax due diligence is critical for informed decision-making."**

**"Critical for informed decision-making,"** agreed Mr. Lee, shaking my hand with the firm grip of someone who had learned that tax compliance was boring but expensive to ignore.

**"We'll have our people coordinate with your people on the reserve documentation,"** added Mr. Kim, delivering this line with the seriousness of someone who would never personally touch a tax form but needed to sound engaged with the process.

**"Looking forward to supporting you through closing,"** I replied, because this was the expected response and Big Four client relationships followed scripts more rigid than tax code itself.

They filed out with the same measured pace they'd filed in with, leather portfolios tucked under arms, phones already buzzing with alerts from their next acquisition meeting where someone else would explain why buying companies was more complicated than it looked.

After they left, Team Leader Park appeared in the doorway. **"That went well. You should be proud."**

**"Just doing my job."**

**"You're doing more than your job. You know that, right?"** He leaned against the doorframe. **"When's the last time you took a proper lunch break?"**

I started gathering my presentation materials, the same tax analysis that would be recycled for next month's acquisition with slightly different exposure amounts and maybe one new jurisdiction to worry about. **"I eat lunch."**

**"Triangle kimbap at your desk doesn't count as a proper lunch."**

How did he know about the triangle kimbap? Had my eating habits become office gossip, or was I just that predictable?

**"It's convenient,"** I said, sliding the papers into a folder. **"Saves time."**

**"Time for what? More work that could wait until tomorrow?"**

The question hung in the air like an accusation. Time for what, indeed. Time to sit quietly and think about things I'd been successfully avoiding. Time to return phone calls from friends who were worried about me. Time to acknowledge that I'd built a fortress of productivity around myself and forgotten why I'd needed protection in the first place.

**"The Morrison account needs attention,"** I said instead. **"Their quarterly review is next week."**

Team Leader Park sighed, the sound heavy with the weight of conversations we'd had before and would probably have again. **"The Morrison account can wait an hour while you eat a real meal. With vegetables. Maybe even sit outside for a few minutes."**

*Outside.* When had I last been outside during daylight hours for reasons other than walking between buildings? When had my world become so small that fluorescent lights felt more familiar than sunlight?

**"I'll think about it,"** I said, which we both knew meant I wouldn't.

But somehow, twenty minutes later, I found myself standing on the sidewalk outside our office building, holding a salad I'd bought from the place next door. The sun felt aggressive against my face, too bright after weeks of artificial lighting.

People walked past with the confident stride of those who belonged in the world outside air-conditioned offices. They wore sunglasses and seemed comfortable in their own skin, like they hadn't forgotten how to exist in natural light.

I found a small table outside the sandwich shop and sat down, feeling oddly exposed. How long had it been since I'd eaten a meal outdoors? Since I'd watched actual people instead of spreadsheet cells?

My phone buzzed. Another message from Yoon, the third one this week. I could see the preview: *"I'm starting to worry. Can we please talk?"*

The salad tasted better than expected. Actual lettuce, not the wilted kind from my refrigerator. Cherry tomatoes that hadn't turned soft and questionable. Grilled chicken that someone had seasoned with care.

A woman at the next table was laughing at something on her friend's phone, her voice bright and uninhibited. When had I last laughed like that? Not the polite chuckle I produced during office meetings, but real laughter that came from genuine joy.

The sun warmed my shoulders through my blazer. Around me, Seoul continued its relentless rhythm, but for fifteen minutes, I was part of it instead of watching it through glass windows.

My phone buzzed again. This time it was a work email, something about the Morrison account that probably didn't need immediate attention but felt urgent anyway.

I finished my salad and gathered my things, the brief moment of normalcy already fading like a photograph left in sunlight too long.

Back inside, the fluorescent lights felt harsh after the gentle warmth of the sun. My desk waited exactly as I'd left it, monitor still glowing with the Morrison files I'd been reviewing.

**"How was lunch?"** Eunji asked as I passed her cubicle. Her succulent garden had gained another resident, a tiny jade plant in a pot painted to look like a miniature watering can.

**"Good. Different."**

**"Different how?"**

I paused, trying to find words for the strange feeling of being a person instead of just a function. **"I sat outside. Ate salad. Watched people."**

**"Sounds radical,"** she said with a smile that was only slightly teasing. **"Think you'll try it again?"**

**"Maybe."**

But even as I said it, I was already settling back into my chair, already pulling up the Morrison files, already letting the familiar rhythm of work wash over me like a tide that never stopped rising.

The salad had been good. The sun had been warm. For fifteen minutes, I'd remembered what it felt like to be part of the world instead of hiding from it.

But fifteen minutes felt like enough adventure for one day.
