# Chapter 3: "Emergency Friendship Intervention"

Elm Street Coffee hadn't changed a single bit in three years. The same mismatched vintage chairs, the same chalkboard menu with handwriting that looked like a doctor's prescription, the same smell of burnt coffee beans and shattered dreams.

Minseo arrived fifteen minutes early because punctuality was one of her few remaining virtues. She claimed a corner table and ordered a caramel macchiato that cost more than her entire lunch budget. The barista, a young man with enough piercings to set off a metal detector, shot her a look that clearly said he could smell her desperation from across the counter.

*Well…he wasn't wrong.*

She was already halfway through her third review of work emails when Yoon walked through the door, and Minseo's first thought was decidedly uncharitable.

***This woman is absolutely glowing.***

Not literally, of course. But Yoon possessed that insufferable radiance that could only come from two sources. Either an unexpected pregnancy or disgustingly perfect romantic bliss. Since she was carrying a large coffee cup, Minseo deduced it was the latter.

Yoon had always been beautiful, but now she looked... complete. Settled. As if she had discovered some universal secret that the rest of humanity was still frantically googling at three in the morning.

**"Mina!"** Yoon's voice rang out like a bell as she waved enthusiastically, acting as though they had seen each other yesterday instead of... when exactly had it been? Her birthday celebration? The same event where Minseo had spent the entire evening hiding in the bathroom, scrolling through her phone and fabricating stomach problems as an excuse for an early escape.

*Those were the days.*

**"Hello."** Minseo rose awkwardly from her seat, and they performed that peculiar dance where both parties attempted to embrace but neither fully committed, resulting in an uncomfortable shoulder-patting situation that satisfied no one.

Yoon settled into the chair opposite her, and the ring immediately caught Minseo's attention. It wasn't ostentatious or gaudy, simply an elegant band adorned with a modest diamond that captured the afternoon sunlight. *Very pretty.*

Minseo despised it. Not the ring itself. No. The ring was genuinely beautiful, but she hated everything it represented. Another person in her social circle had successfully navigated the treacherous waters of adult happiness while she remained stranded, playing amateur detective.

**"So."** Minseo spoke first, recognizing that someone needed to break the silence, and it clearly wouldn't be Yoon, who sat there glowing like the inner core of a nuclear reactor. *Way too bright.*

**"How have you been?"**

**"Wonderful! Truly wonderful actually."** Yoon raised her left hand, and the diamond practically blinded Minseo with its brilliance. **"I have news to share."**

**"I can see that."** Minseo arranged her expression into what she hoped resembled genuine excitement rather than…anything else to be fair. **"When did this happen?"**

**"Two weeks ago. Jin proposed at that little restaurant in Hongdae. You remember the one? Terrible lighting but the most incredible kimchi jjigae in the city? It was absolutely perfect. Well, except for the part where I cried so violently I couldn't see the ring properly, and then I knocked over the soup bowl while trying to put it on."**

Yoon's laughter filled the space between them. And it sounded…happy. Minseo remembered making sounds like that once upon a time. The memory felt ancient.

**"That's... that's really wonderful."** The words emerged with more sincerity than Minseo had expected. The functional part of her psyche genuinely felt happiness for her friend. The broken part was already calculating the minimum acceptable duration for this social obligation before she could fabricate an excuse and retreat to her apartment and her cat.

**"There's more."** Yoon's smile somehow managed to become even more radiant, which Minseo hadn't thought was physically possible. **"We're getting married in two months."**

*Two months?* Minseo nearly choked on her overpriced coffee. **"That seems... way too soon."**

**"Hey hey I know it sounds impulsive, but we've been together for three years now, and we simply... we know, you understand? Besides, Jin's grandmother's health is declining, and we want her to witness our ceremony."** Yoon's expression softened with genuine emotion. **"Life is too precious to waste waiting for the perfect moment."**

Something in her delivery felt pointed, though gentle, making Minseo suspect this coffee meeting wasn't quite as spontaneous as it had initially appeared.

**"Actually,"** Yoon continued, **"that's precisely why I wanted to see you today. I have a request to make."**

Here it was. The true purpose behind this hipster coffee shop charade, pretending they hadn't been virtual strangers for the better part of a year.

**"I want you to be my maid of honor."**

The words struck Minseo like a physical blow. **"Excuse me?"**

**"I understand we haven't been in regular contact lately, and I realize the timeline is quite short, but you remain one of my dearest friends... You supported me through university, through that complete disaster with Taemin, through my nightmarish job search. I simply cannot imagine celebrating my wedding without you there."**

Minseo's throat constricted. **"Yoon, I'm not certain I'm the appropriate person for this responsibility. I mean, I can barely manage my own existence at the moment, let alone..."**

**"That's exactly why I'm asking you."** Yoon reached across the table and captured Minseo's hand in hers. **"When was the last time you participated in something that wasn't work related or... whatever is it that you've been pursuing in your apartment?"**

*A direct hit to her vulnerabilities.*

**"I engage in enough ‘activities’, I will have you know,"** Minseo protested weakly.

**"Online shopping and cyberstalking your ex-boyfriend don't qualify as meaningful pursuits."**

*Another devastating blow.* **"How could you possibly..."**

**"Minseo. You liked one of his photographs from two years ago at three in the morning last month. Instagram provides notifications about such behavior."**

The desire to simply dissolve into the floor and continue sinking until she reached the earth's core was overwhelming. **"That was completely accidental."**

**"Was it really?"** Yoon's voice remained gentle but relentless. **"Because Jin's cousin works at that coffee shop on Garosu-gil, and she mentioned seeing you there last week. Sitting alone, watching the entrance as if you were expecting someone specific."**

*That stupid coffee shop… It was the place where he used to work on his laptop while she pretended to read but actually spent her time observing his typing patterns. She had visited there last Tuesday after work, convincing herself she simply craved quality coffee. Two hours later, she had nursed a single americano and marinated in her own pathetic desperation.*

**"I wasn't..."**

**"You were hoping to encounter him."** It wasn't a question.

The most devastating aspect was Yoon's accuracy. She had been hoping. *But hoping for what, exactly? Some cinematic moment where he would enter and suddenly realize his terrible mistake? A scenario where he would observe her looking successful and composed and beg for reconciliation?*

*Dear God, she was pathetic.*

**"Perhaps,"** she admitted in barely more than a whisper.

Yoon's expression melted into sympathy. **"Oh, darling."**

**"Please don't 'oh darling' me. I'm fully aware how this sounds. I'm aware how I sound. I simply... I don't know how to stop."** The confession tumbled out before she could prevent it. **"I know everything about his new girlfriend. I know she practices yoga at six in the morning and drinks matcha lattes and has never posted a photograph displaying a double chin. I know they went hiking last weekend and that she wore my anniversary hoodie and somehow made it look superior to how I ever did."**

**"Minseo..."**

**"I know he's happier without me. It's evident in every photograph, every story, every ridiculous hiking selfie. And I cannot stop looking because it's like... like deliberately irritating a wound. It hurts, but at least it's something tangible."**

Her words hung in the air between them, heavy with humiliation. Yoon remained silent for a long moment, simply observing her with those perceptive eyes that saw far too much.

Finally, she spoke. **"How long has it been since you went on a proper date?"**

**"I'm not certain. Some time ago."**

**"How long since you spent time with friends who aren't me ambushing you at a coffee shop?"**

**"That's not..."**

**"How long since you did something purely because it brought you joy?"**

Minseo opened her mouth to respond and realized she had no answer. *When had she last pursued something for happiness rather than distraction? When had she last felt genuine excitement about anything beyond the temporary high of a successful work presentation?*

**"I'm concerned about you,"** Yoon said quietly. **"Not merely because of the Instagram surveillance, although that's certainly... troubling. I'm worried because you've essentially vanished. The Minseo I know has passionate opinions about everything and makes terrible jokes and actually shows up to social events."**

**"He's not simply..."**

**"Yes, he is."** Yoon's voice carried newfound firmness. **"He's just some man who failed to appreciate what he possessed. That doesn't grant him permission to sabotage your life from a distance."**

Minseo wanted to argue, but the words refused to come. Perhaps because, in the depths of her heart, she recognized the truth in Yoon's statement. Perhaps because she was exhausted from defending someone who probably never thought about her anymore.

**"So here's what's going to happen,"** Yoon continued, and suddenly her tone carried that authoritative quality that meant serious business. The same tone she had employed when forcing Minseo to apply for her current position despite her conviction that she was unqualified. **"You're going to be my maid of honor. You're going to help me plan this wedding. And you're going to remember what it feels like to actively participate in your own existence."**

**"Yoon..."**

**"Also, you need to stop checking his social media accounts."**

**"I can't simply..."**

**"Yes, you absolutely can. Look, I'm not demanding you delete everything permanently, but perhaps... take a break? Just until after the wedding?"**

**"I require Instagram for work purposes..."**

**"Then log out and provide me with your password. I'll change it and return it to you in two months."**

This was absolutely insane. **"You cannot be serious."**

**"I'm completely serious. When was the last time you went an entire day without checking his profile?"**

Minseo attempted to recall and came up empty.

**"That's what I thought."** Yoon leaned forward intently. **"Two months, Minseo. Give me two months of your actual life, not the version where you're constantly comparing yourself to some woman you don't even know."**

**"What if I'm incapable of managing it?"**

**"Then at least you will have attempted something different. But I don't believe that's going to happen."** Yoon smiled, and for the first time since Minseo had arrived, it appeared less like pity and more like... faith, perhaps? **"I think you might actually rediscover who you are when you're not performing for an audience that doesn't exist."**

The barista called out someone's order, and Minseo nearly laughed at the absurdity of this entire conversation. Here she sat, receiving a lecture from her best friend about her internet habits as if she were a teenager caught engaging in inappropriate online behavior.

**"There's one additional matter,"** Yoon said, and something in her tone triggered Minseo's alarm bells.

**"What now?"**

**"Jin has a brother. Daniel. He's single, he's kind, and he'll be attending the wedding."**

**"Absolutely not. I refuse."**

**"I'm not suggesting you marry him or anything dramatic. I'm simply saying perhaps it's time to remember that other people exist in this world."**

**"Yoon..."**

**"He's a pediatrician. He enjoys hiking and cooking and has never in his entire life posted a shirtless mirror selfie."**

**"That last detail is actually quite suspicious."**

Yoon laughed. **"Just speak with him. One conversation. If you find him unbearable, I'll never mention it again."**

Minseo observed her friend sitting there, practically vibrating with wedding planning enthusiasm and genuine concern about her disastrous personal life. Six months ago, she would have agreed immediately. Six months ago, she had still been the type of person who said yes to social opportunities.

**"What about your photographer?"** she asked, primarily to redirect the conversation.

**"What about him?"**

**"Have you actually met this individual?"**

**"Oh, that's an entirely separate catastrophe."** Yoon rolled her eyes dramatically. **"Jin discovered him through a friend of a friend. Apparently, he's exceptionally talented but possesses zero social skills and considers weddings to be ridiculous spectacles. Jin's exact words were 'he behaves as if we're asking him to photograph a public execution.'"**

**"He sounds absolutely charming."**

**"Precisely. I'm simply hoping he appears and takes acceptable photographs without making everyone profoundly uncomfortable."**

Despite everything, Minseo almost smiled. **"What's his name?"**

**"Jae-min. Lee Jae-min. Why do you ask?"**

**"Just wondering if I should research him online to ensure he's not a serial killer."**

Yoon stared at her incredulously. **"You realize that's exactly the type of behavior I'm discussing, don't you? You want to investigate the wedding photographer but you won't consider meeting a perfectly lovely pediatrician."**

She had an excellent point. An extremely uncomfortable point.

Minseo took a deep breath. **"Very well."**

**"Very well, what?"**

**"Very well, I'll be your maid of honor. Very well, I'll meet Daniel. Very well, I'll..."** she swallowed with difficulty. **"I'll attempt to stop checking Instagram every five minutes."**

Yoon's face illuminated like a festival lantern. **"Really?"**

**"Really. But if this wedding transforms into some sort of disaster, I'm holding you entirely responsible."**

**"Agreed."** Yoon reached across the table and squeezed Minseo's hands firmly. **"This is going to be beneficial for you, Minseo. I can sense it."**

Minseo wished she possessed her friend's confidence. But as she sat there, observing Yoon's ridiculously joyful expression, she realized something significant… for the first time in months, she wasn't thinking about him. She wasn't wondering about his activities or his companions or whether he ever spared her a thought.

It was progress, at least.

**"So,"** she said, retrieving her phone and locating the Instagram application. **"What exactly does a maid of honor do?"**

Yoon grinned triumphantly. **"Everything. But don't worry, I'll guide you through it."**

Minseo stared at her phone screen, at the small Instagram icon that had served as her portal to misery for the past six months. Her thumb hovered over it uncertainly.

Then she deleted it.

The icon vanished, and for a moment, she felt as if she might panic. As if she had just severed a limb or forgotten how to breathe properly.

But then Yoon began discussing color schemes and venue disasters and whether two months provided sufficient time to locate a dress that wouldn't make her resemble a walking cupcake, and Minseo realized something. The world hadn't ended. The sky hadn't collapsed.

Her ex-boyfriend's life was continuing without her constant surveillance, and somehow, that was... acceptable.

Perhaps it was even better than acceptable.
